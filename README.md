# Context
A lot of analytics are available for measuring the size of a digital audience, bounce rates, referrers and so on. But I know of no tools to measure the actual civic impact of an article or project. How much did a reader retain from an article? Did they read all of it? Would they be able to answer basic questions after reading and article? Were they moved to action to volunteer within their community? These questions are important and require simple tools to be easily deployed and used in newsrooms.
